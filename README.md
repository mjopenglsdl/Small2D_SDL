Small SDL 2D Game Engine (C++)
===========

A skeleton of C++ 2D framework with SDL2 library.
I started this project in 2011 and the origin purpose is to make an easy-to-use framework for fast game development in desktop environment.

I have added support for both Windows(**Code::Block**) and Mac_OSX(**xCode**).

Library that you will need in order to compile & link:
* SDL2: https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
* SDL2_image: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
* SDL2_ttf: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/



The current features include:
* Concise code
* 3 game states 
* Move the player
* Basic collision detection
* Basic UI widgets: button, label

My Short Plans:
* MVC architecture
* Player jump
* Lua Integration
* pch header (less header inclusion)
* XML based configuration file and loading
* Graphic improvement
* Shared pointer
* makefile and cmake

Further Considerations:
* OpenGL integration

I hope this will help you learn the basic ideas behind game development.
Any support would be highly appreciated :-)
