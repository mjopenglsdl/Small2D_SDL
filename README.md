Small SDL 2D Game Engine (C++)
===========

A skeleton of small C++ 2D framework with SDL library.
I started this project in 2011 and the origin purpose is to make a framework for fast graphic development in desktop environment.

I recently moved it to **SDL2** with integration of **xCode**.

The current progress：

* 3 game states 
* Move and jump the player
* Basic collision detection

I hope this will help you learn the basic ideas behind game development.
Any support would be highly appreciated :-)
